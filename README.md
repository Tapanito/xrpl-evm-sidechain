# ETHDublin Workshop


This project uses hardhat to deploy and interact with EVM Sidechain smart contracts.

## Setup

In the `hardhat.config.ts` file enter your `Metamask` private key. Note, this is for tutorial purposes ONLY.


## Hacks

- Remove `"ethers": "^5.7",` dependency from the `package.json` when interacting with smart contracts.
